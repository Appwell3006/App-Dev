Instructions
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Follow the steps below to create a pull request, a popular way to create and review code.

Create a Github account at https://github.com/ using your sti.edu.ph e-mail address.

I. Creating a Repository

  In the upper-right corner of your page, click on the drop-down menu, and select New repository. A repository is usually used to organize a single project. 
  In the Repository name box, enter app-dev.
  In the Description box, write My first repository.
  Set your repository as Public.
  Tick the Add a README file checkbox. A README file is a file with information about your project.
  Click Create repository.

II. Creating a Branch 

  Under the Code tab of your app-dev repository, click the drop-down at the top of the file list that says main.
  Create a branch named readme-edits. Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.
  Click Create branch: readme-edits from main. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.
  Under the readme-edits branch you created, click the README.md file.
  Click the pencil icon to edit the file.
  In the editor, write some information about your favorite series/movie using different Markdown elements. See syntax here: Markdown Cheat Sheet | Markdown Guide
  In the Commit changes box, write a commit message that describes your changes. Ex. Add info about favorite series
  Click Commit changes.

III. Creating a Pull Request

  Now that you have changes in your main's branch, you can open a pull request. It allows you to propose your changes and request review from someone. 
  Under the Pull requests tab of your app-dev repository, click New pull requests.
  In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits. You can now see its difference from main.
  Click Create pull request.
  Type appropriate information in the description box.
  Click Create pull request.
